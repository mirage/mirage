 * FUNCTION
 *	vector unsigned int _isnanf4(vector float x)
 *
 * DESCRIPTION
 *      The _isnanf4 function returns a vector in which each element indicates 
 *      if the corresponding element of x is NaN.
 *
 *      On the SPU, this function always returns 0, since NaNs are not 
 *      supported.
 *
 * RETURNS
 *      UINT_MAX (0xFFFFFFFF)  if the element of x is a NaN
 *      0        (0x00000000)  otherwise (always on the SPU)
 *
