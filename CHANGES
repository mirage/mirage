0.9.2 (09-July-2013):

* [xen] Add Netif test to wait for a fixed number of ring slots > 0
* [xen] Add Evtchn.close to Xen backend.
* [xen] Disable tree-loop-distribute-patterns to workaround crash with
  gcc-4.8.  Temporary fix until we isolate the bug.
* [xen] Improved the interface of Io_page, implement some missing bits
  in Gnt.
* [xen] Several modules now have an interface similar to the one in
  the libxc bindings for OCaml. This makes it possible to write one
  application that can be compiled for the UNIX or the Xen backend.

0.9.1 (11-Jun-2013):
* [xen] add mmap stubs to make the default Bigarray module happy.
* OS.Netif.create no longer creates the tuntap interface.  Hotplug events
  are generated from the mirari calling functions instead, removing the
  policy from this library.

0.9.0 (22-May-2013):
* [xen] Add a simple 'resume hook' mechanism for xen devices
* [xen] Update to new shared ring signature in 0.4.0
* [xen] Allow device providers to be added later
* [xen] Move the blkif implementation to ocaml-xen-block-driver
* [xen] Io_page.string_blit has now an interface similar to String.blit
* [xen] Console.write_s has been renamed Console.write_all
* [xen] Gnttab.unmap_exn now throws an exception on failure, like the
  xenctrl version. This makes it possible to run the same blkback code
  in kernelspace and userspace.

0.8.1 (27-Mar-2013):
* [xen] Fix the Xen block interface to wait for init correctly.

0.8.0 (12-Feb-2013):
* Remove `mir-build` script as the Mirari builder does its job now.
* [xen] add Str module C stubs, adapted to work in the Xen backend.

0.7.2 (08-Feb-2013):
* [xen] Fix the size of the start-of-day Xenstore and console rings.
* Quieten the verbosity of devices sleeping in Xen, to avoid console
  overflow situations.
* Install the packed `cmx` along with the `cmxa` to ensure that the
  compiler can do cross-module optimization (this is not a fatal error,
  but will impact performance if the `cmx` file is not present).

0.7.1 (20-Dec-2012):
* [unix] Update devices API to use Cstruct 0.6.0

0.7.0 (20-Dec-2012):
* [xen] Add support for VM suspend/resume/migrate
* [xen] Support for multiple network interfaces
* [xen] Use new shared-memory-ring, removing old builtin version.
  This is all OCaml except for the memory barrier assembly instructions.
* Update Cstruct to new API in 0.6.0

0.6.1 (15-Dec-2012):
* [xen] Add an unused ?dev parameter to Netif.create to match
  the UNIX version.
* [script] Add a mir-build script which converts a native output
  object into a Xen kernel.  It does command-line parsing to be
  compatible with other Xen outputs in the future (such as the
  kFreeBSD or Javascript backends, when they are ready).

0.6.0 (11-Dec-2012):
* [xen] refresh to ocaml-4.00.1 runtime.  You *must* use the
  correct OPAM switch to match versions, or bad things will
  happen when the resulting binary is run.

0.5.0 (10-Dec-2012):
* [xen] Fix spurious floating point exceptions on some machines.
* [ns3] Add NS3-based simulator backend.
* [unix] Add pcap-based Ethernet access in addition to tuntap.

0.4.1 (04-Nov-2012):
* [xen] fix incorrect reference counting in Io_pages that could
  potentially cause pages to be reused too early.
* [xen] move Xenstore protocol implementation out to a separate
  library that provides it as a functor.
* [unix] ignore SIGPIPE in the OS.Main.run function.

0.4.0 (11-Sep-2012):
* [xen] Add support for mapping and unmapping grant references
* [xen] Support Xen 4.2 reserved console and xenstore maps.
* [xen] Switch the Xenstore and console rings over to use cstruct.
* [xen] Add Evtchn virq interface for stub xenstored.
* [xen] Add Evtchn.unbind.
* [netif] fix checksum calculation code for odd-sized packets.

0.3.0 (04-Sep-2012):
* Initial public release.
