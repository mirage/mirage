Trunk:
* Set on_crash = 'preserve' in default Xen config.
* Automatically install dependencies again, but display the live output to the
  user.
* Include C stub libraries in linker command when generating Makefiles for Xen.
* Add `Conduit` and `Resolver` code generators.
* Generate a `*.xe` script which can upload a kernel to a XenServer.
* Generate a libvirt `*.xml` configuration file (#292).

1.2.0 (2014-07-05):

The Mirage frontend tool now generates a Makefile with a `make depend`
target, instead of directly invoking OPAM as part of `mirage configure`.
This greatly improves usability on slow platforms such as ARM, since the
output of OPAM as it builds can be inspected more easily.  Users will now
need to run `make depend` to ensure they have the latest package set,
before building their unikernel with `make` as normal.

* Improve format of generated Makefile, and also colours in terminal output.
* Add `make depend` target to generated Makefile.
* Set `OPAMVERBOSE` and `OPAMYES` in the Makefile, which can be overridden.
* Add an `ENTROPY` device type for strong random sources (#256).

1.1.3 (2014-06-15):
* Build OPAM packages in verbose mode by default.
* [types] Add `FLOW` based on `TCPV4`.
* travis: build mirage-types from here, rather than 1.1.0.

1.1.2 (2014-04-01):
* Improvement to the Amazon EC2 deployment script.
* [types] Augment STACKV4 with an IPV4 module in addition to TCPV4 and UDPV4.
* Regenerate with OASIS 0.4.4 (which adds natdynlink support)

1.1.1 (2014-02-21):
* Man page fixes for typos and terminology (#220).
* Activate backtrace recording by default (#225).
* Fixes in the `V1.STACKV4` to expose UDPv4/TCPv4 types properly (#226).

1.1.0 (2014-02-05):
* Add a combinator interface to device binding that makes the functor generation
  significantly more succinct and expressive.  This breaks backwards compatibility
  with `config.ml` files from the 1.0.x branches.
* Integrate the `mirage-types` code into `types`.  This is built as a separate
  library from the command-line tool, via the `install-types` Makefile target.

1.0.4 (2014-01-14):
* Add default build tags for annot, bin_annot, principal and strict_sequence.
* Renane `KV_RO` to `Crunch`

1.0.3 (2013-12-18):
* Do not remove OPAM packages when doing `mirage clean` (#143)
* [xen] generate a simple main.xl, without block devices or network interfaces.
* The HTTP dependency now also installs `mirage-tcp-*` and `mirage-http-*`.
* Fix generated Makefile dependency on source OCaml files to rebuild reliably.
* Support `Fat_KV_RO` (a read-only k/v version of the FAT filesystem).
* The Unix `KV_RO` now passes through to the underlying filesystem instead of calling `crunch`, via `mirage-fs-unix`.

1.0.2 (2013-12-10):
* Add `HTTP` support.
* Fix `KV_RO` configuration for OPAM autoinstall.

1.0.1 (2013-12-09)
* Add more examples to the FAT filesystem test case.
* Fix `mirage-tcpip-*` support
* Fix `mirage-net-*` support

1.0.0 (2013-12-09):
* Adapt the latest library releases for Mirage 1.0 interfaces.

0.10.0 (2013-12.08):
* Complete API rewrite
* [xen] XL configuration phase is now created during configure phase, was during run phase.

0.9.7 (2013-08-09):
* Generate code that uses the `Ipaddr.V4` interface instead of `Nettypes`.

0.9.6 (2013-07-26):
* fix unix-direct by linking the unix package correctly (previously it was always dropped).

0.9.5 (2013-07-18):
* completely remove the dependency on obuild: use ocamlbuild everywhere now.
* adapt for mirage-0.9.3 OS.Netif interfaces (abstract type `id`).
* do not output network config when there are no `ip-*` lines in the `.conf` file.
* do not try to install `mirage-fs` if there is no filesystem to create.
* added `nat-script.sh` to setup xenbr0 with DNS, DHCP and masqerading under Linux.

0.9.4 (2013-07-09):
* build using ocamlbuild rather than depending on obuild.
* [xen] generate a symbol that can be used to produce stack traces with xenctx.
* mirari run --socket just runs the unikernel without any tuntap work.
* mirari run --xen creates a xl config file and runs `xl create -c unikernel.xl`.

0.9.3 (2013-06-12):
* Add a `--socket` flag to activate socket-based networking (UNIX only).
* Do not use OPAM compiler switches any more, as that's done in the packaging now.
* Use fd-passing in the UNIX backend to spawn a process.

0.9.2 (2013-03-28):
* Install `obuild` automatically in all compiler switches (such as Xen).
* Only create symlinks to `mir-foo` for a non-Xen target.
* Add a `mirari clean` command.
* Add the autoswitch feature via `mirari --switch=<compiler>` or the config file.

0.9.1 (2013-02-13):
* Fix Xen symlink upon build.
* Add a `--no-install` option to `mirari configure` to prevent invoking OPAM automatically.

0.9.0 (2013-02-12):
* Automatically install `mirage-fs` package if a filesystem crunch is requested.
* Remove the need for `mir-run` by including the final Xen link directly in Mirari.
* Add support for building Xen variants.
* Initial import of a unix-direct version.
