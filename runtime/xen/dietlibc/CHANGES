    there?)
  add truncate64 and ftruncate64 and prototype for truncate (only had ftruncate)
  Michal Ludvig (SuSE) ported the diet libc to the x86_64 architecture (the
    upcoming AMD Hammer chips!).  You can't even buy the chips yet and
    the diet libc already supports it!  Amazing ;-)
  Michal's patch also fixed several of the outstanding warnings.  Thanks!
  Andre sent a patch to add ARM profiling.  He says it does not work
    yet, but it's a start.
  added getdents64 backwards compatibility and include it in large file
    support #defines
  perror now checks if the message is NULL like glibc (Thomas Ogrisegg)

  cleanups from Florian LaRoche

0.17:
  fix several bugs in getservent_r
  Gunnar Ritter reported the following:
    moved tcgetpgrp and tcsetpgrp to unistd.h
    adjusted lstat->lstat64 #define to make it work with function pointers
    move __dietlibc__ #define from features.h to diet
  Thomas Ogrisegg sent x86 memccpy and strncpy routines and introduced
    an dietfeatures.h #define WANT_FULL_POSIX_COMPAT
  Thomas also sent me profiling support (so far only on x86, but
    profiling/PORTING describes what needs to be done for other
    architectures)!
  add contrib/dprof.c, also from Thomas.
  Andreas Krennmair sent a patch to add the BSD regex interface to
    libcompat
  Andre noticed that __dtostr never sets first to false.  Oops!
  Andre has provided a largely untested patch that seems to fix the problem.
  Igor Gilitschenski sent a patch for the "%8.7lx" issue.
  abort did not flush all stdio streams
  fix some nasty regular expression bugs
  write a stupid malloc checker (contrib/debug-realloc.c) to help me
    debug my regular expressions.  Please read contrib/debug-realloc.txt
  our i386 memchr,memcmp were broken for the count=0 case
  fix DNS domain search
  i386 memccpy exchanged esi and edi :-(  I should do more checks before
    accepting external code...

0.16:
  "diet -v" or "diet -Os" segfaulted without further arguments.
  Andre found two very embarassing bugs in my four lines of md5 glue.
    I need to get more sleep.
  Thanks Ogrisegg found that ptrace does not work as documented and
    provided a wrapper that emulates the glibc behaviour.
  Dirk Engling saved 8 bytes and 4 cycles in the ARM clone()
  fix ptrace.h for S/390 and ARM
  provide a PORTING document so we don't lose track of which file need
    to be touched to port the diet libc to a new platform.
  remove a few warnings
  provide a prototype for usleep.
  make __dtostr work on ARM by using long instead of long long.
    Idea by Dirk Engling.
  fix an argument counting bug in *scanf (Thomas Ogrisegg)
  Forgot an #endif in asm/sigcontext.h (Mike Castle)
  Kurt Garloff sent in patches to
    fix struct termios on non-x86 architectures
  printf("%+05d\n",500) was broken (Raimar Falke told me, Olaf fixed it)
  create libcompat.a (and move daemon to it)
  add getdelim and getline
  *printf now recognize 'z' integer flag (and ignore it)
  Dirk Engling provided a strcpy.S for ARM.
  Olaf: fixed *scanf familie. It hadn't wored with "long long".
  Hans Lermen fixed i386/getenv.S
  diet -Os no longer discards -fpic and -fno-pic
  fix i386 rand/random to use correct RAND_MAX (thanks, Jaroslav
    Macodiseas)
  sys/ipc.h now includes sys/types.h
  Olaf: started to make the sparc64 port
  scandir should not sort if compar() is NULL (reported by Andrea Marrosu)

0.15:
  vfork sucks.  I reverted to the old behavior where vfork==fork.
  fix bsearch (and remove i386 assembly bsearch, needs to be redone).
  Thanks Ogrisegg sent a patch to make the PA-RISC unified syscall
    thread-safe!
  remove vfork and add alarm to dynamic syscalls.
  fix diet-dyn to link in dyn_dstop.o and not dyn_stop.o.
  The MD5 code generated unaligned accesses when passed an unaligned
    pointer on little endian ARM and MIPS.
  MIPS unified syscall didn't compile anymore.
  Put up new mipsel target to cross compile for little endian mips.
  The mips target will again explicitly set endianness to big endian.
  Compiling natively on a MIPS box should not touch the endianness.
  Duh, when we removed return0, we broke tzset when the time zone parser
    was disabled.  Uwe Ohse noticed this.  Thanks!
  Fix gethostbyname to match host names case insensitively in /etc/hosts.
    Oops, this was reported 6 weeks ago but I overlooked the email.
    Thanks, Denis Rachal!
  vsnprintf's zero termination was broken.
  Uwe Ohse found a few more bugs:
    Remove WANT_BUGGY_GLIBC_STRSEP.  The Linux man page is broken, glibc
      does it correctly.
    Make inet_aton use strtoul instead of strtol
    fdopen would close the file descriptor if it could not malloc the
      buffer.
    strftime updates.
    Make _FILE_OFFSET_BITS includes -Wundef clean
  Andre found a typo in endian.h for big endian mips
  Ryan told me that fmod was not included in libm.  Oops.
  strstr(whatever,"") returned NULL, not whatever.  Found by a new test
    suite entry for strstr that I wrote.
  Thomas Ogrisegg suggested or sent patches for the following:
    add <asm/sigcontext.h> for profiling support.
    make strncpy a #define in string.h to save a few bytes.
    an i386 assembler getenv implementation (roughly half the size)
    add grantpt, ptsname, unlockpt
  add a getenv test suite entry.
  Andre contributed an ARM assembler md5 implementation and he fixed mmap
    on ARM.
  add glibc macro names in sys/reboot.h.  Mentioned by Laurent G. Bercot
  getservent_r did not parse lines without aliases.  Thanks, Jaroslav
    Macodiseas!
  fix MIPS start code (argv[0] was always corrupt)
  removed annoying -Wconversion gcc switch
  add -v to diet.c and fix MIPS CFLAGS in diet.  Thanks, Johannes Stezenbach
  Kurt Garloff sent these diffs:
    add fdatasync (and make it a pthread cancellation point)
    numerous alpha issues, like using .quad instead of .long for
    offsets, change strip to -strip in Makefile (so a failing strip does
    not abort the make), try to be more friendly to the gcc 2.96 that
    SuSE 7.1 AXP ships with.

0.14:
  fix brk again (missing __brk, trivial oversight)
  a new i386/atol.S that is 4 bytes smaller (and faster, too!).  Thanks,
    Thomas Ogrisegg!
  Thomas also contributed a PA-RISC port including testandset, so
    libpthread will work once we implement clone!  Great work, Thomas.
  made the fake locale more believable.
  If you need gettext, use http://www.ca.postgresql.org/~petere/gettext.html
  moved _exit into the unified syscall on x86.
  Uwe Ohse found many more bugs:
    getpass EINTR handling, ttyname, sysconf_cpus with SLASH_PROC_OK,
    liblatin1 was more or less completely broken if you gave it chars as
    arguments, not ints (signedness).  execvp had a buffer overflow in
    case a PATH element exceeded PATH_MAX, but it's not a security
    problem since setuid programs need to set their path to some known
    value anyway.
    hasmntopt did not work with foo=bar style options
  Uwe also improved ftw's stack usage.
  Put movl instead of popl rationale in comment in i386/unified.S since
    three people have suggested saving a few bytes with popl now ;)
  I discovered __attribute__((malloc)) and started using it.  For gcc 3,
    it improves the optimizer when functions return malloced pointers.
  Steven Rostedt pointed out that my setvbuf was broken with regard to
    size==0 and sent a patch to fix it.
  Thomas Ogrisegg made setenv smaller.
  Olaf: implemented the parisc clone and an atomic testandset, modified the
    libpthread to respect the parisc UPgrowing stack. still non functional,
    because the unified syscall uses errno :(
  tcgetospeed read from the wrong termios field.  Thanks, Gunnar Ritter!
  Fixed asprintf (relied on vsnprintf(NULL,...) to return length but
    don't write anything which was no longer the case.  It also
    allocated one byte unnecessarily, which Uwe Ohse found.
  Fix ttyname (readlink does not \0-terminate, forgot to do that).

0.13:
  add readdir64 and automatic mapping if _FILE_OFFSET_BITS == 64
  make diet not include the linker safeguard stuff when preprocessing
  Olaf: port to S/390!
  fix vfork (it was put into dietlibc.a twice)
  res_query did not initialize last
  diet (not diet-dyn, of course) now adds -static to the gcc command line
  fixed fflush on input streams (tic from ncurses exposed this)
  duh, there is an alarm system call, too, so we use it and not setitimer
  fix comparison in gmtime_r that caused Jan 1 to be converted to Dec 32.
  rewrote __dtostr (it also has one more argument now)
  Thanks to Erik Troan for bringing these to my attention:
    make putenv behave like glibc (putenv("HOME") == unsetenv("HOME"))
    fix strncat for the case where n == 0 (security implications?)
    fix bsearch (it didn't find the very last element in the array, same
      bug in both the C and the i386 assembly version).
    fixed FNM_PATHNAME in fnmatch
  fix brk (the syscall was documented incorrectly in the Linux man page)
    Thanks, Thomas Ogrisegg!
  added negated character classes to fnmatch (not required by POSIX)
  make the utmp routines open utmp read-only if read-write doesn't work.
  remove syscalls.c directory, it is obsolete now with unified syscalls

0.12:
  more contributions from Frank Klemm.
  iconv can now do UCS-2, too.
  Imported several x86 assembly routines from Wouter van Kleunen.
  Lots of bug fixes, and several more i386 specific versions of common
    routines to make them smaller.
  add memmem (a GNU extension that looks useful)
  several changes from Michal Ludvig: inttypes.h gets C99 macros,
    add pivot_root syscall, %n for *scanf.
  add adjtimex (thanks, Laurent BERCOT)
  add Frank Klemm's optimized md5
  add -Os option to diet (see diet.1).
  several IPv6 constants and HZ were missing, thanks Johannes Kloos.
  add 32-bit uid/gid syscalls.
  add rand48 (thanks, Johannes Kloos)
  fixed a lot of bugs in getopt* (thanks, Johannes)
  add strxfrm and tweak limits.h.  glib-1.3.8 now compiles without changes.
  add a few more module syscalls.  modutils-2.4.9 now compiles without changes.
  fix gethostent alias list termination.  Major oops.
  add execle and two DNS constants (from Johannes Kloos).
  opendir did not close-on-exec (thanks, Laurent Bercot).
  DNS will now properly signal errors and set h_errno.
  A few more cleanups (thanks, Andreas Jabs and Matthias Andree).
  Added an uber-cool linker safeguard feature!  Idea by Matthias Andree.
    If you enable WANT_SAFEGUARD in dietfeatures.h, diet will include an
    external reference to a symbol that is only in the diet libc.  So,
    when you accidentally link a diet libc compiled object file against
    glibc, the linker will barf.  This will bloat your object files, but
    you can remove all the references with "strip -R .note" from
    the binaries in the end (which you should do anyway).
  fix ARM unified syscall (select did not work).
  add getpwent_r ala glibc and replace getpwent
  do the same for getgrent and getspent
  remove entlib (new code is smaller)
  rewrite getserv* to use parselib (and provide ..._r, too)
  add getpwnam_r and getpwuid_r
  rewrite getproto* to use parselib (and protive ..._r, too)
  Olaf muddled with the dynamic linker.  It's a clean-room
    implementation in the sense that it once worked for Olaf in a clean
    room ;)
  add if_nameindex and if_freenameindex.
  fixed arm unified syscalls to work with current binutils (; is no
    longer a line separator but starts a comment, switched to .macro)
  changed all st_[cma]time types to signed long so comparisons against
    LONG_MIN will work correctly.  (GNU tar does this)
  fixed two bugs regarding ungetc.
  add getusershell, setusershell, endusershell (for vs_ftpd)
  add prctl, dirfd (also for vs_ftpd)
  fixed strftime (was completely hosed)
  added real make install target

0.11:
  fix major oops in DNS routines (only with WANT_FULL_RESOLV_CONF enabled).
  fix vsscanf bug (Thanks, David Chappell).
  add floor, ceil and memchr prototypes.
  add __builtin_expect and expect #defines for gcc versions below 3.0
  cleaner errno vs __errno_location handling
  add placeholder iconv (iconv_open will always return EINVAL)
  try to remove kernel 2.4 header dependency in IPv6 sockaddr_in6
    initialization of getaddrinfo.
  fix vsnprintf %X (printed lower case)
  I wrote a new getopt.  It appears to actually work (it is POSIX
    compliant, it does not sort argv like the GNU version) and is only
    a little over 300 bytes on x86.
  Guillaume Cottenceau just wrote me that strncat should be even more
    broken than it already is: it should append n bytes AND THEN \0!
    I wonder how many programmers have produced off-by-one errors here...
  Fix regexec offset return.  autoconf now believes that diet libc has
    POSIX regular expressions.
  Fix fnmatch (a/b/* matched a/b/c/d even if FNM_PATHNAME was set)
  Fix regular expression match for x* when there is no x at all.
  Fix memory leak in error case in gethostbyname(2|).  Thanks, Dietz Pr?pper.
  Add %h to vsnprintf.
  Add FAQ.
  Make %h work for signed numbers and add %hh to vsnprintf.
  initgroups ignored the group argument :-(
  remove printf references and nested functions from glob.
  added an errno in libpthread that will display a prominent linker
    warning.
  started getting rid of kernel headers.  Big task! :-(
  add res_mkquery.  The diet libc can now compile and link mtr.
  Olaf: added a lot of code in libdl (not yet complete), changed the
    startup code to make it work with his libdl and ld.so (needs still work
    too)
  __dns_readstartfiles only took the first domain or search path.
    Thanks, Anthony de Boer
  Olaf: added clone and a new unified_syscall for PowerPC
    also dynlinker is now available (i386 only at this time)
  crufted together a stdarg.h implementation from the various gcc headers.
  implement getopt_long (ugh, the GNU people need professional help)
  fixed word delimiters in regex (they looked for space, i.e. "," did
    not work as delimiter)
  errno.h now declares sys_errlist and sys_nerr.
  added mkdtemp.
  Uwe Ohse reported all of the following bugs:
    ttyname should return 0 if !isatty.
    realpath returns NULL if "." cannot be opened
    putenv erroneously accepted (and mishandled) entries without "=".
    popen returned 255 instead of 127 if /bin/sh could not be run.
    fgetc did not set the internal EOF indicator on EOF.
    bsearch contained an assumption about integer arithmetic overflow
      behavior.
    system did not set SIGCHLD and thus contained a race.
    popen did not set close-on-exec and could leak an fd on malloc error.
    daemon did not check whether open returns an fd below 3
    perror did not save errno.
  Olaf: Peter Jones reported some problems with perror; strerror had the
    same problem.
    Peter also posted a patch to atexit/exit. With some modifications it is
    now implemented.
  Unbuffered stdio and ungetc can no longer be disabled.  I will try to
    implement part of it using ELF weak symbols.
  Added minimal sysconf (tehe) from David Chappell.
  Added overflow handling for strtoul and strtol.
  Added WANT_ETC_HOSTS in dietfeatures.h and made gethostbyname/2 use
    it before falling back to DNS if enabled.
  Added a littie backwards compatibility cruft for gpm (man, do these
    sources stink!)
  Added openpty.
  Squeeze a few bytes off the is* routines, courtesy of Peter Jones.
  Fix fseek return value.
  Add dirname and basename.
  Add a few i386 math routines contributed by Frank Klemm.
  Fixed getservent (did not allow _ and - in the aliases).
    Thanks, Oden Eriksson
  Added a float.h so configure believes we have ANSI header files.
  Fix a lot more stdio bugs that Uwe Ohse pointed out.
  Olaf: has added a new scanf and printf core that is suitable for all
    scanf and printf function implementations
  Imported a few more functions and optimizations from Frank Klemm (he
    also rewrote dtostr to have more precision)
  Olaf: checked in a new sig* function family (based on rt_sig*).
    legacy <2.2 signal-handling doesn't work at the moment.
  Made rudimentary iconv that can convert back and forth between
    iso-8859-1, utf-8 and ucs-4 (for debugging).
    Thanks to Markus Kuhn for the excellent utf-8(7)!

0.10:
  update getpagesize.
  add personality.
  add "%*s" and "%*.*s" support to vsnprintf.
  add putchar (apparently arm-linux-gcc will substitute printf("\n")
    with putchar('\n') behind your back...?!
  import include/scsi/ from glibc.
  add iopl.
  add execl and sigdelset prototypes.
  add getopt_long stuff to getopt.h (may compile but won't link).
  add RPC headers (no code yet).
  add mlockall, munlockall
  make "diet gcc foo.c" work.
  added Sun RPC code and removed as many warnings as possible in a
    heroic act of self-mutilation.
  added getproto* and getdtablesize for the RPC cruft :-(
  added getpass.  mount from util-linux actually compiles now!
  fix the sig*set routines.  mount actually works now *bg*
  fix fwrite dividing by zero when trying to fwrite n records of size 0.
  added an initial regex implementation (3500 bytes!!!).
  add llseek and lseek64 with optional lseek fall-back.
  add res_init.
  add asprintf (ugh, what an ugly function).
  expanded arpa/nameser.h to include backwards compatibility defines
  add ut_name alias to ut_host in struct utmp.
  add inet_ntop, inet_pton, gethostbyname2.
  add sysinfo, recvmsg, sendmsg.
  add endmntent, getmntent, setmntent.
  fix fnmatch (thanks, Guillaume Cottenceau!)
  add setenv.
  remove __restrict from mntent.h, add __restrict__ removal alias for
    older gcc versions in sys/cdefs.h.
  add rlim_t, sig_atomic_t declarations.
  add sigsetjmp #define for __sigsetjmp (oops).
    (Thanks to Chris Siebenmann for these three bug reports)
  add a gruesome hack to printf floating point to accept %f and kludge
    together support for %.2f.  Don't look at the code, please!
  fixed tcsetpgrp (oops, this is embarassing!  Thanks, Chris Siebenmann)
  imported fix for entlib by Jeff Garzik.
  add glob implementation from Guillaume Cottenceau (Thanks!!)
  add libdl fragments from Olaf (Yeah!  One step closer to dynamic linking!)
  add REG_ICASE and word start/end handling to my regular expressions.
  my regular expressions now actually match substrings (i.e. "foobar" to "bar").
  wrap getcwd to comply to man page (the syscall returns the number of
    bytes, not the buffer)
  add realpath.
  fix vfprintf.
  fix *scanf %s zero termination.
  add abs, labs, llabs.
  add <sys/io.h>, ioperm syscall.
  add flock to <sys/file.h>
  fixes to bsearch and the regular expressions.
  add fake herror.
  add scandir and alphasort.
  add killpg
  implemented a gross hack to make libpthread compile when
    dietfeatures.h does not define WANT_THREAD_SAFE (it's empty then).
  add getaddrinfo and freeaddrinfo (man, what a fucked up interface!)
  fix sigsuspend (syscall had completely fscked up arguments!)
  RLIM_INFINITY from the kernel is broken.  Thanks to Chris Siebenmann
    for sending a patch.
  add getserv*.
  add WANT_FULL_RESOLV_CONF so that the DNS routines use "domain" and
    "search" from resolv.conf.

0.9:
  fixed initgroups (oops)
  Cleanup appending file open for stdio (thanks, James Antill)
  imported vfprintf fix from James Antill.
  add fnmatch
  change index, rindex and bcmp as weak ELF symbols (were #defined before)
  Olaf added character classes to *scanf.
  Put object and library files into a separate directory (bin-$ARCH).
  Add "cross" make target to make all architectures.
  Add "diet" program and man page.
  Add getgrnam, getgrgid
  Add cfmakeraw (Thanks, Antonio Musumeci)
  localtime won't call gettimeofday when the tzfile parser is used.

0.8:
  vsnprintf(0,...) estimated the length of strings with a padding width
    incorrectly.
  new reboot() from Olaf.
  added prototypes for getsockopt and setsockopt.
  added experimental sem* and shm*
  define EXIT_SUCCESS and EXIT_FAILURE
  added setvbuf (only changes mode, not buffer)
  added dietwarning.h (woohoo, linker warnings!) and used it to warn of
    insecurity (system, sprintf) or bloat (printf and stdio).
  added qsort() and bsearch().  Benchmark on 1000 random ints:
    glibc: 679414 cycles qsort and 3352 cycles bsearch
    diet libc: 300010 cycles qsort, 553 cycles bsearch
    I have no idea why glibc is so slow.
  added __isnan (references by libm.a from glibc).
  added popen() and pclose().  Now the diet libc can link slsh (from
    S-Lang!)
  corrected usleep.  It was more of an msleep until now.
  corrected __dtostr (it looped when trying to format "0.0").
  several fixes to stdio (thanks to S-Lang's excellent test suite!)
  added ungetc (does it work?)
  added inet_aton (yuck!)
  added gethostbyname, gethostbyaddr, gethostbyname_r and gethostbyaddr_r
  added h_errno and __h_errno_location
  added inet_ntoa
  added setpgrp and getpgrp, strsignal and execv (thanks, Olaf)
  add bcopy, index, rindex macros
  add isgraph and isxdigit
  add strftime (ugh!!!)
  Olaf fixed strftime, gmtime_r leap year bug.
  Jeff Garzik contributed a spec file.  I put it in contrib and hope
    everbody knows what to do with it...
  Olaf checked in a ton of libpthread stuff.
  added mkstemp using /dev/urandom (harder to guess than getpid()).
  add large file backwards compatibility support (so gzip will run on
    kernel 2.2 and 2.0)
  added shutdown
  added nice
  added pseudo-locale support for is* (they are now weak aliases,
    isupper -> __isupper_ascii etc).  So, for example, liblatin1 can
    overwrite the default is* functions.
  added liblatin1.a
  added tzfile implementation (does it work for anyone else?)
  added syslog(3) (thanks to Rene M?ller!)
  Jeff Garzik contributed getgr*, getpw* and getsp* in one tiny package.
    Thanks!
  merged duplicate code in execv and execvp into exec_lib.o

0.7.2:
  added several prototypes to already implemented functions and
    <sys/reboot.h>.  Thanks for Abraham for pointing this out.
  added prototypes for process group and dup syscalls.  Thanks to
    Abraham again.  He also contributed an implementation for daemon(),
    an ugly BSD hack.  I decided to diversify the lib/ directory a
    little and now created a libugly/ directory for stuff like system()
    and daemon() ;-)
  added libstdio and moved all that stdio crap from lib/ there.  The
    idea is to start separating now what we will separate for shared
    libraries anyway.
  optimized x86 unified-syscall by Olaf.
  added limits.h, removed __ARCHBITS from endian.h (use __WORDSIZE from
    limits.h instead)
  added remove.c and enough cruft to limits.h to make it compile lzo,
    lzop and bzip2.
  added mktime, asctime_r, asctime and ctime (needed for gzip).
  Someone will need to implement a reader for the glibc localtime file
    format some day (man tzfile, ugh!) :-(
  added unlink prototype to unistd.h.
  added gmtime and gmtime_r.
  fixed sparc unified syscall error handling (please upgrade!).
  removed readdir glibc compatibility cruft.
  removed stat glibc compatibility cruft.
  oops, my fread was broken for pipes.
  Olaf found a bug in pipe() for sparc, too.

0.7.1:
  optimized away the static arrays from __ltostr and __lltostr.
  optimized away the static arrays (and more!) from strtoul and strtoull.
  added system (by Olaf).
  added tolower and toupper
  added getopt from Olaf (~600 bytes on x86!)
  added clone for mips (by Olaf).
  fixed longjmp and setjmp on sparc not to require glibc include files.
  added pause for all (by Olaf).
  added __attribute__ ((__const__)) to ctype.h
  added isupper and islower.
  added putc and putchar as macros.
  added strcasecmp and strncasecmp (thanks to Abraham vd Merwe for
    insightful discussions and patches I partially used for the last three)
  added getpriority and setpriority (also by Abraham)
  oops, I broke strtoul in a recent optimization attempt.
  oi, setjmp and longjmp were broken on other platforms, too!
    Thanks to S?bastien C?t? for reporting this.

0.7:
  clone support for i386,alpha,arm and sparc by Olaf.
  Initial dynamic loading glue for i386, also by Olaf.
  We don't have a dynamic loader yet, so this is not yet usable.
  added readv, sigdelset, sigaltstack, sigfillset, sigismember, usleep,
    vsprintf, writev, all by Olaf.
  imported readdir fix from Guillaume.  Mhh, can the kernel interface
    really be this broken?
  Found a kludgy way to detect whether the kernel includes define struct
    stat64 (they also define STAT64_HAS_BROKEN_ST_INO).  If this does
    not work for you, please tell me!
  Removed bogus __seek_types enum, it's a bunch of #defines now.
  Fixed stdio line buffering.  The code was already there but I forgot
    to mark stdio and stdout as line buffered.  This should really be
    done dynamically using isatty, though.
  Removed superfluous "if (1)" in execvp.c

0.6.14:
  *scanf did not append the 0 byte for %s.
  added creat and changed creat to call open directly instead of open64.
  did for fread what 0.6.10 did for fwrite.
  repaired buffered stdio a little (line buffering is still not
    supported).
  [All of these bugs have been reported by Guillaume.  Thanks!]
  added __pure__ to strchr and strrchr in <string.h>

0.6.13:
  included COPYING to make clear that the diet libc is covered by the
    GNU General Public License (and _not_ the LGPL).  That means that
    you need to obtain a license from me if you want to use the diet
    libc in a proprietary program that you want to distribute.
  The x86 unified syscall swapped arguments #4 and #5 and noone
    noticed until now!  Thanks to Guillaume Cottenceau for reporting
    this!
  The malloc had a subtle bug with small allocations that could cause
    segfault.  Guillaume reported it, Olaf fixed it.

0.6.12:
  added assert, statfs and fstatfs
  added include/net/if.h so fget compiles again.

0.6.11:
  added putenv.

0.6.10:
  fixed fwrite.  It returned the number of bytes written, not the number
    of records.  Thanks to Albert D. Cahalan for pointing this out.
  fixed fgets.  It returned EOF on empty lines.  Thanks, Erik Frey.
  added brk and sbrk.  harold@nb.com.sg made me do it.

0.6.9:
  fixed execvp not to return on ENOENT
  did for {open|read|close|seek|tell}dir what I did for stat before.
    The glibc compatibility part is currently non-functional.
  fixed white space handling in sscanf " (" would not match " (".
  fixed printf to accept 'l' flag.
  fixed getpwuid (ignored last line)

0.6.8:
  Olaf contributed initial thread-safe syscalls for i386, alpha, sparc,
    mips and arm.  I did the one for ppc.  They can be enabled in dietfeatures.h.
  added strlcpy and strlcat from OpenBSD.
  added stat64, fstat64 and lstat64.
  added endian.h and made ending of strlen.c endianness-aware
  added string routines size tweak to dietfeatures.h.  Most of the
    string routines have been unrolled.  This is up to three times as
    fast but creates up to three times larger code.  Now you can disable
    the unrolling.
  added sendfile.
  I also added pread.  It works on x86 and sparc but not on ppc and mips.
    I have no idea what's going on.  strace disagrees with the kernel.
    Can anyone help?  I asked the Linux kernel mailing list for help, too.
  added a few aliases of the type __libc_open for open.  nm on
    libpthreads.so indicates that we will need them.

0.6.7:
  the sources now compile without warnings with -Wall.
  printf now prints "(null)" when %s is passed NULL.  This can be
    removed with WANT_NULL_PRINTF in dietfeatures.h
  added vfprintf, execl, ttyname.
  stat, lstat and fstat are now #defined to __dietstat, __dietlstat and
    __dietfstat so they can use the normal kernel struct stat.
    stat, lstat and fstat are now C wrappers that convert to the glibc
    struct stat.  So we can avoid that overhead for programs that use
    dietlibc headers.

0.6.6:
  changed the Makefiles so you can now set CFLAGS on the command line
  added memccmp (analogous to memccpy) and strncmp.
  Olaf fixed another bug in the sparc unified syscall.
  Paul Clifford contributed a C version of his strlen.S that is much
    more efficient than the previous strlen on all platforms!  It also
    looks like technology from Roswell. ;-}
  added a "real" stdio.  Well, almost.  Please contribute!
  added dietfeatures.h so you can remove features you don't need.
  removed debug code from vsnprintf that changed \0 to ' ' (argh!).
  stdio now works with simple programs and minigzip from libz.
  stdio uses some major trickery to avoid linking the stdio, stderr and
    stdout (and reserving space for them) when they are not used.

0.6.5:
  Red Plait <redplait@ixcelerator.com> found several bugs in diet libc,
    most of them bugs in the new header files, but also missing sigset
    functions.
  Paul Clifford contributed an assembly strlen.S for ARM and fixed
    several bugs.
  Fixed ppc/setjmp and mips/pipe.
  Olaf contributed a new sparc unified syscall.

0.6.4:
  declared is* static inline in getservent.
  added assert_fail, strtoul, isalpha, isdigit, isalnum, isascii.
  changed strlen to return 0 when passed NULL.
  new, much smaller unified syscall for MIPS.  Thanks to Olaf the Mad
    Scientist who actually implemented this without access to a MIPS
    box, just from reading the architecture manual.  And it worked out
    of the box.
  started a set of system includes, mainly so that I can use lcc and
    my alpha-linux cross compiler (which is unable to cross-compile
    glibc).  diet libc can now be compiled without any include files
    from a normal libc.  The includes do declare more than diet libc
    currently delivers and they are still far from complete for real
    applications.
  I will only add assembly versions that are smaller _and_ faster than
    the C version.  Larger routines are only accepted if they are called
    very often and are substantially faster.
  added i386 assembly strchr, which is smaller and faster than the old
    version.  It is, however, larger than the version contributed by
    proton (thanks, anyway).
  added i386 strlen (31% faster, 14% smaller)
  "make t" will now create a map file called "mapfile".

0.6.3:
  added sys_errlist, strerror and perror
  added isblank
  added atol

0.6.2:
  mmap for ARM didn't compile.  Thanks, Paul!

0.6.1:
  split mmap into the architecture specific subdirectories.
  getenv now copes with environ==NULL, thanks Paul Clifford.
  Paul also contributed a smaller ARM startup code.

0.6:
  strcat returned the wrong result.  Thanks, Dietz Pr?pper.
  strtod now understands a negative exponent (oops, thanks Bertram Barth)
  Port to arm-linux-gnu, but on the Netwinder I use for testing the
    __dtostr does not work (I have no idea why!)
  The MIPS port now uses (much smaller) non-PIC code.  That means that
    the applications you link against diet libc also have to be compiled
    non-PIC.  I suggest copying the CFLAGS from the diet libc Makefile.
    Thanks to Ralf B?chle for helping me with this!
  I made subdirectories for the architectures and use VPATH to override
    VPATH so that make finds the source file automatically.  That should
    simplify the sources greatly.
  Olaf Dreesen contributed Alpha support including setjmp and longjmp!
  ARM and MIPS now also have setjmp and longjmp
  "compile" and "load" are now make targets.  Use them for djb programs.
  added contrib/elftrunc.c which will remove unnecessary ELF headers.
    Again, contributed from Olaf.  Great work!

0.5.12:
  printf also does signed numbers.
  If you don't use atexit, dietlibc now does not link exit, only _exit.
  *printf now correctly returns the number of bytes written.
  Olaf contributed experimental sscanf and vsscanf implementations.
  If passed NULL as buffer, snprintf will not write anything but still
    return the number of bytes it would have written.
  Initial MIPS port!   (Oh, the agony!)
    No setjmp and longjmp support yet!  Please contribute!
  I even implemented unified syscalls for MIPS.  Still, MIPS code is
    almost twice the size of SPARC code.  If anyone knows why: please
    tell me!

0.5.11:
  I implemented new unified syscalls for x86, sparc and ppc, this time based
    on .s files and not .c files, and I moved the syscalls into
    subdirectores to clean the dietlibc sources up a little.
  A binary consisting of printf("%s is %d\n","olaf",23) is now
    2864 bytes on sparc
    2488 bytes on intel
  I kludgily implemented fprintf(stdout,... and fprintf(stderr,...
    to make a few more applications work.
  Olaf Dreesen also implemented some unified syscall stuff for x86.
  He discovered that with our unified syscall interface it actually
    costs <10 bytes total to make all system calls thread safe!
  I implemented atexit() (can register up to 4 callbacks).
  I implemented strtod and __dtostr (the opposite).  Now we can add
    floating point support to vsnprintf and sscanf!

0.5.10:
  I actually saw that I can not only merge the errno handling code of
    the system calls on x86, I can also merge the rest (including the
    arguments) except for setting the system call number.  All those
    system calls are now just a jump to a unified system call handler.
    I got rid of x86openclose again.  The savings are substantial:
    chown from embutils went from 7664 to 7184 bytes!
    If I'd move the system call wrappers to assembly language, I could
    even reduce the alignment (does not matter since it's just a jump
    anyway) and get rid of the "ret" behind each jump (one byte per
    system call!)

0.5.9:
  added memchr, strpbrk, strstr, strtol, isspace (hehe)
  fixed strdup
  fixed return values for strcpy and strcat (thanks to Norbert Berzen)
  Olaf Dreesen contributed a strtol and initial {sn|vsn|}printf implementation
    (no signed integers, only strings and unsigned integers (but
    supporting octal, hex and decimal).  Thanks, Olaf!  (by the way:
    that code must be wonderful, I don't understand it at all *bg*)
    Olaf's printf does understand padding like in "%08d" and "%8d" and
    automatically pads pointers with '0'.
  Rewrote the x86 start code, old: 22 instructions, new: 12 instructions.
  Thanks to proton for inspiration on this.
  The new x86 start code also does not reference exit any more, thus saving
  64 bytes for executables that don't call exit explicitly.
    [insert maniacal laughter] EVERY BYTE COUNTS!1!! ;-)
  Moved errno and environ to start.S, saving no byte binary size but
    speeding up compilation and slightly shortening dietlibc.a ;-)
  For x86: joined open and close into one assembler file, sharing the
    errno handling.  This is a feasibility test and it actually saves a
    few bytes.  I think I will reimplement the _syscall[1-6] macros on
    all platforms now to share the errno handling code for them.

0.5.8:
  fixed strchr to be able to look for 0.

  added _llseek, ftruncate, getpgid, getresgid, getresuid, getsid,
  memccpy, memmove, mprotect, setregid, setresgid, setresuid, setreuid,
  strncpy, swapon, truncate, strtok, strtok_r, strspn, strcspn (all
  contributed by Olaf Dreesen)

  added execvp, getcwd

  fixed __xmknod

  Note: can it be that the ftw interface really is so broken that I
  cannot implement it without having to implement some searching data
  structure?  I included an experimental ftw implementation that will
  not follow symlinks.

0.5.7:
  oops, if_nametoindex was broken!

0.5.6:
  ported to ppc-linux.
  fixed i386 sigsetjmp (I mistyped the function name)
  included sigjmp.c

0.5.5:
  added wait, sys_siglist, longjmp/setjmp/sigsetjmp for i386 and sparc
  actually, it wasn't fork that wasn't working for sparc, it was pipe.
  I fixed it now.
  dietlibc/SPARC assumes -msupersparc (does not provide div, mul, etc)
  fixed readdir to use getdents and not the intel inline asm

0.5.4:
  ported to sparclinux (sparc32 only).  Beware: does not work yet.
  added raise, abort, readlink, strcat, geteuid, geteuid, wait3, access

0.5.3:
  added tcsetattr and getenv to compile e3

0.5.2:
  added vhangup, tcgetattr, isatty and memcmp for fgetty
    (http://www.fefe.de/fgetty/)
  added localtime from uC-libc.

0.5.1:
  stat and friends actually work now.  Yuck!  Another case of
    translation between kernel and userland.  Why can't the kernel
    people and the libc people simply agree on a standard?
  removed many unnecessary includes to speed up compilation.
  added -fomit-frame-pointer and i386 compilation target to reduce code size.
  inlined socketcall to reduce code size.
  "load" and "compile" are examples for djb code.

0.5:
  Olaf Dreesen contributed a much smaller implementation of malloc and friends.
  each object file is now treated with "strip -x -R .note -R .comment"
  split each system call into a separate object file
  added ntohs, htons, alarm, if_indextoname and if_nametoindex

0.4.1:
  oops, the strchr implementation was wrong.  Thanks Jens Laas!

0.4:
  copied opendir and friends from uC-libc.
  added getservent and getservby* in gerservent.c

0.3:
  remove readdir system call
  added getdents system call
  added getpwnam/getpwuid implementation in getpwnam.c
  added a few string functions (in str*.c)
