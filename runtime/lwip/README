OCaml bindings to the LWIP TCP/IP stack.

Dependencies:
- LWT 2.1.0+ from http://ocsigen.org/lwt

Works on:
- MacOS X with osxtuntap: http://tuntaposx.sourceforge.net
- Linux 2.6 with tuntap compiled in

To use it:

$ make all
$ sudo make test

This sets up a listening echo server on 192.168.0.2 7

$ telnet 192.168.0.2 7
<type stuff in>

$ nc -q 3 192.168.0.2 7 < Makefile

...and you should see the Makefile echoed back to you.
The echo server is defined in lib/main.ml
