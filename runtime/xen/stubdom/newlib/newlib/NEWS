* new --enable-newlib-elix-level configuration option
* positional arg I/O support for printf family (--enable-newlib-io-pos-args)
* support for the Fujitsu FRV architecture added by Red Hat
* support for Motorola Altivec and SPE added by Red Hat
* new small reentrancy structure support

*** Major changes in newlib version 1.10.0:

* libtool support for i[3456]86-pc-linux native builds
* addition of libm/machine/i386 directory, for i386 fast math routines

*** Major changes in newlib version 1.9.0:

* i[3456]86-pc-linux support

* Long Double I/O support via the WANT_IO_LONG_DBL flag

* addition of reentrant environment functions

* addition of xscale and AVR platforms

* severe reduction in the number of warnings issued

* consolidation of many RTEMS features into shared headers

*** Major changes in newlib version 1.8.2:

* RTEMS features and fixes from Joel Sherrill.

* More work on reentrant routines.

* Floating point math library check, --enable-newlib-hw-fp.

*** Major changes in newlib version 1.8.1:

* Added check for --enable-newlib-mb configure option which defines the
  MB_CAPABLE macro.  Multibyte support for JIS, SJIS, and EUC-JP implemented.

* Reduced code size for libm modules.

* Replaced the BSD malloc with Doug Lea's malloc.

*** Major changes in newlib version 1.8.0:

* Added simulated signal handling functions _raise_r, _signal_r, raise, and
  signal except for sparc-sun-sunos*, i[3456]86-*-sco*, and a29k-*-* systems,
  which already provide access to signal.  The signal functionality provided
  does not interact with hardware generated signals.
    
* Added reentrant function rand_r from POSIX.1c.

* Removed _asctime, _next, _scanpoint, and _signgam fields from struct
  _reent.  These are no longer necessary since there are now functions
  that explictly support multiple threads (asctime_r, ctime_r, gamma_r,
  gmtime_r, lgamma_r, localtime_r, rand_r, & strtok_r).


*** Major changes in newlib version 1.7.0:

* Cross compiler target libraries are now built in a subdir of the top level
  build directory.

  Old way: build
                /newlib
                       /m68020
                              /m68881
  New way:
           build
                /m68k-coff
                          /m68020
                                 /m68881

  where m68020 and m68881 are multilib subdirectories

* m68k targets support --disable options to avoid building unwanted versions
  of the libraries.

  --disable-softfloat - don't build libc, libg++, etc. for -msoft-float
  --disable-m68881    - don't build libc, libg++, etc. for -m68881
  --disable-m68000    - don't build libc, libg++, etc. for -m68000
  --disable-m68020    - don't build libc, libg++, etc. for -m68020

  These options have *no* effect on the default libraries, so if the default
  is -m68020, --disable-m68020 is nilpotent.

* Reentrancy support in libm removed.

* strtok, strtol, strtoul, assert, div, ldiv, qsort, vfprintf
  replaced with NetBSD versions.

* Support for systems with 32 bit "doubles" added.

* unctrl added.

* dtoa.c updated from master dtoa.c soruces (netlib.att.com)

* Various bug fixes.

*** Major changes in newlib version 1.6.1:

* Added reentrant functions (asctime_r, ctime_r, gmtime_r, localtime_r,
and strtok_r) from POSIX.1c.

* Removed _asctime_r and _strtok_r functions.
