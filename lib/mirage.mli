(** {1 What is MirageOS?}

    MirageOS is a library operating system that can build standalone unikernels
    on various platforms. More precisely, the architecture can be divided into:

    - {e operating system libraries} that implement kernel and protocol
      functionality, ranging from low-level network card drivers to a full
      reimplementation of the TLS protocol, through to a reimplementation of the
      Git protocol to store versioned data.

    - A set of {e typed signatures} to make sure these libraries are consistent
      and can interoperate. As all the library are almost all pure OCaml code,
      we have defined {e a set of OCaml module types} that encode these
      conventions in a statically enforcable way. We make no compatibility
      guarantees at the C level, but compile those on a best-effort basis.

    - Finally, MirageOS is also a {e metaprogramming compiler} that generates
      OCaml code. It takes as input: the OCaml source code of a program and all
      of its dependencies, the full description of the deployment target,
      including configuration values (like the HTTP port to listen on, or the
      private key or the service being deployed). The `mirage`CLI tool uses all
      of these to {e generate a executable unikernel}: a specialised binary
      artefact containing only the code what is needed to run on the given
      deployment platform and no more.

    It is possible to write high-level MirageOS applications, such as HTTPS,
    email or CalDAV servers which can be deployed on very heterogenous and
    embedded platforms by changing only a few compilation parameters. The
    supported platforms range from minimal virtual machines running on cloud
    providers, or processes running inside Docker containers configured with a
    tight security profile. In general, these platform do not have a full POSIX
    environment; MirageOS does not try to emulate POSIX and focuses on providing
    a small, well-defined, typed interface with the system components. The
    nearest equivalent to the MirageOS approach is the WASI (wasi.dev) set of
    interfaces for WebAssembly.

    {2 Is everything really written in OCaml?}

    While most of the code is written in OCaml, a typed, high-level language
    with many good safety properties, there are pieces of MirageOS which are
    still written in C. These bits can be separated in three categories:

    - The OCaml runtime is written in C. It needs to be ported to the platform
      that MirageOS is trying to target, which do not support POSIX. Hence, the
      first component to port to a new platform is the OCaml runtime.

    - The low-level device drivers (network, console, clock, etc) also need some
      C bits.

    - The base usual C bindings; some libraries are widely used and
      (unfortunately) very hard (but not impossible) to replace them completely
      without taking a big performance hit or having to trust code without much
      real-world usages. This is the case for low-level bit handling for crypto
      code (even if we try to make sure allocation is alway handled by the OCaml
      runtime) as well as arbitrary precision numeric computation (e.g. gmp).
      Ideally we could image rewriting all of these libraries in OCaml if we had
      an infinite amount of time in our hands.

    {2 MirageOS as a cross-compilator}

    The MirageOS compiler is basically a cross-compiler, where the host and
    target toolchain are identical, but with different flags for the C bindings:
    for instance, it is necessary to pass [-freestanding] to {e all} C bindings
    to not use POSIX headers. The MirageOS compiler also uses a custom linker:
    eg. not only it needs a custom OCaml's runtime [libasmrun.a], but it also
    needs to run a different linker to generate specialised executable images.

    Historically, the OCaml ecosystem always had partial support for
    cross-compilation: for instance, the
    {{:https://github.com/ocaml-cross/opam-cross-windows} ocaml-cross} way of
    doing it is to duplicate {e all} existing opam pacakges by adding a
    [-windows] suffix to their names and dependencies; this allows normal
    packages and windows packages can be co-installed in the same opam switch.

    {3 MirageOS 3.x}

    MirageOS 3.x solves this by duplicating only the packages defining C
    bindings. It relies on every MirageOS backend registering a set of [CFLAGS]
    with [pkg-config]. Then every bindings uses [pkg-config] to configure their
    [CFLAGS] and [ocamlfind] to register
    {{:https://github.com/ocaml/opam-repository/blob/master/packages/zarith-xen/zarith-xen.1.7/files/mirage-install.sh#L20}
      link-time predicates}, e.g. additional link time options like the name of
    the C archives. Finally, the final link step is done by querying ocamlfind
    (using the custom registered predicates) to link the list of dependencies'
    objects files with the result of OCam compiler's [--output-obj] option.

    {4 MirageOS 4.x}

    MirageOS 4 solves this by relying on [dune]'s built-in support for
    cross-compilation. This is done by gathering all the sources of the
    dependencies locally with [opam-monorepo], and by creating a
    `dune-workspace` file describing the C flags to use in each
    cross-compilation "context". Once this is set-up, only one [dune build] can
    cross-compile the unikernel target with all its local sources.

val docteur :
  ?mode:[ `Fast | `Light ] ->
  ?name:string key ->
  ?output:string key ->
  ?analyze:bool runtime_arg ->
  ?branch:string ->
  ?extra_deps:string list ->
  string ->
  kv_ro impl
(** [docteur ?mode ?name ?output ?analyze remote] is a read-only, key-value
    store device. Data is stored on that device using the Git PACK file format,
    version 2. This format has very good compression factors for many similar
    files of relatively small size. For instance, 14Gb of HTML files can be
    compressed into a disk image of 240Mb.

    Unlike {!crunch}, [docteur] produces an external image which means that less
    memory is used to keep and get files. The image can be produced from many
    sources:

    - A local Git repository (like [file://path/to/the/git/repository/])
    - A simple directory (like [file://path/to/a/simple/directory/])
    - A remote Git repository (via SSH, HTTP(S) or TCP/IP as what [git clone]
      expects)

    If you use a Git repository, you can choose a specific branch with the
    [?branch] argument (like [refs/heads/main]). Otherwise, this argument is
    ignored.

    If you use a simple directory, it can be a relative from your unikernel
    project ([relativize://directory]) or an absolute path
    ([file://home/user/directory]).

    If a required file is produced by a [dune] rule, you must notice it via the
    [extra_deps] argument.

    For a Solo5 target, users must {i attach} the image as a block device:

    {[
      $ solo5-hvt --block:<name>=<path-to-the-image> -- unikernel.{hvt,...}
    ]}

    The user is able to specify the name of the block device (default to
    ["docteur"]). The user can also specify the output of [docteur.make], the
    tool which generate the image (default to ["disk.img"]).

    For the Unix target, the program [open] the image at the beginning of the
    process. An integrity check of the image can be done via the [analyze] value
    (defaults to [true]).

    It's possible to use the file-system into 2 modes:

    - [`Light]: any access requires that we reconstruct the path to the
      requested file. That means that we will need to extract a few additional
      objects before the extraction of the requested one. [`Light] does not
      cache anything in memory but it can be slower if the requested file is
      deep in the directory structure.
    - [`Fast]: reconstructs and cache the layout of the directory structure when
      the unikernel starts: it might increase boot-time and bigger memory
      requirements. However, [`Fast] allows the device to decode only the
      requested object so it is faster than the [`Light] mode. *)

type kv_rw
(** Abstract type for read-write key/value store. *)

val kv_rw : kv_rw typ
(** Implementations of the [Mirage_kv.RW] signature. *)

val direct_kv_rw : string -> kv_rw impl
(** Direct access to the underlying filesystem as a key/value store. Only
    available on Unix backends. *)

val kv_rw_mem : ?clock:pclock impl -> unit -> kv_rw impl
(** An in-memory key-value store using [mirage-kv-mem]. *)

val chamelon :
  program_block_size:int runtime_arg ->
  ?pclock:pclock impl ->
  block impl ->
  kv_rw impl
(** [chamelon ~program_block_size] returns a {!kv_rw} filesystem which is an
    implementation of {{:https://github.com/littlefs-project/littlefs} littlefs}
    in OCaml. The [chamelon] device expects a {i block-device}.

    [unikernel.ml]:
    {[
      open Cmdliner

      let program_block_size =
        Arg.(value & opt int 16 & info [ "program-block-size" ])
    ]}
    [config.ml]:
    {[
      let db =
        let program_block_size =

        in
        let block = block_of_file "db" in
        chamelon ~program_block_size block
      in
    ]}

    For Solo5 targets, you finally can launch the unikernel with:

    {[
      $ solo5-hvt --block:db=db.img unikernel.hvt
    ]}

    The block-device must be well-formed and {i formatted} by the [chamelon]
    tool:

    {[
      $ dd if=/dev/zero of=db.img bs=1M count=1
      $ chamelon format db.img 512
    ]} *)

val tar_kv_rw : ?pclock:pclock impl -> block impl -> kv_rw impl
(** [tar_kv_rw block] is a read/write tar archive. Note that the filesystem is
    append-only. That is, files can generally not be removed, [set_partial] only
    works on what is allocated, and there are restrictions on [rename]. *)

val ccm_block :
  ?nonce_len:int -> string option runtime_arg -> block impl -> block impl
(** [ccm_block key block] returns a new block which is a AES-CCM encrypted disk.

    {b Note} also that the available size of an encrypted block is always
    divided by 2 of its real size: a 512M block will only be able to contain
    256M data if it is encrypted.

    You can either use a fresh block device as encrypted storage. This does not
    need any preparation, just using [ccm_block] with the desired [key]. If you
    have an existing disk image that you want to encrypt, you can use the
    [ccmblock] tool given by the [mirage-block-ccm] opam package.

    {[
      $ ccmblock enc -i db.img -k 0x10786d3a9c920d0b3ec80dfaaac557a7 -o edb.img
    ]}

    Accept the key as a runtime argument, in [unikernel.ml]:
    {[
      open Cmdliner

      let aes_ccm_key =
        let doc = "The key of the block device (hex formatted)" in
        Arg.(required & opt (some string) None & info ~doc [ "aes-ccm-key" ])
    ]}

    Then, into you [config.ml], you just need to compose your block device with
    [ccm_block]:

    {[
      let encrypted_block =
        let aes_ccm_key =
          Runtime_arg.create ~pos:__POS__ "Unikernel.aes_ccm_key"
        in
        let block = block_of_file "edb"
        ccm_block aes_ccm_key block
      in
    ]}

    Finally, with Solo5, you can launch your unikernel with that:

    {[
      $ solo5-hvt --block:edb=edb.img \
        --arg="--aes-ccm-key=0x10786d3a9c920d0b3ec80dfaaac557a7" \
        unikernel.hvt
    ]}

    You can finally compose a file-system such as {!chamelon} with this block
    device (and you have a encrypted file-system!):

    {[
      let fs = chamelon ~program_block_size encrypted_block
    ]} *)

(** {2 Mimic devices}

    For some implementations which requires to communicate with an external
    resources (such as a webserver or a git server), we must hide the underlying
    implementations that depend on the {i target} (such as the network stack)
    and are necessary for these implementations.

    The aim of [mimic] is to offer first of all the ability to initiate a TCP/IP
    connection independently of the chosen {i target} (see
    {!val:mimic_happy_eyeballs}).

    The resulting {i device} can then be composed with other protocols like TLS,
    Git or HTTP and it is through this resulting {i device} that other devices
    can initiate an internet connection to a peer (like a webserver or a Git
    server). *)

    which initiate a global {i happy-eyeballs} loop. By this way, an underlying
    instance works to initiate a TCP/IP connection from an IP address or a
    domain-name.

    For the domain-name resolution, we ask the {i happy-eyeballs} instance to
    resolve the given domain-name {i via} its DNS client.

    The resulting {i device} can be used {b and} re-used to for any {i clients}

(** {2 Git client configuration} *)

(** Users can connect to a remote Git repository in many ways:

    - TCP/IP

    The devices defined below define these in composable ways. The
    [git_client impl] returned from them can be passed to Git or Irmin in order
    to be able to {i fetch} and {i push} from/into a Git repository.

    The user is able to restrict or enlarge protocol possibilities needed for
    its application. For instance, the user is able to restrict only the SSH
    connection to communicate with a Git repository or the user can handle
    TCP/IP and SSH as possible protocols to communicate with a peer.

    For instance, a device which is able to communicate {i via} TCP/IP and SSH
    can be implemented like:
