0.7.0 (20-Dec-2012):
* [xen] Add support for VM suspend/resume/migrate
* [xen] Support for multiple network interfaces
* [xen] Use new shared-memory-ring, removing old builtin version.
  This is all OCaml except for the memory barrier assembly instructions.

0.6.1 (15-Dec-2012):
* [xen] Add an unused ?dev parameter to Netif.create to match
  the UNIX version.
* [script] Add a mir-build script which converts a native output
  object into a Xen kernel.  It does command-line parsing to be
  compatible with other Xen outputs in the future (such as the
  kFreeBSD or Javascript backends, when they are ready).

0.6.0 (11-Dec-2012):
* [xen] refresh to ocaml-4.00.1 runtime.  You *must* use the
  correct OPAM switch to match versions, or bad things will
