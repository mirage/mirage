NAME
       test-describe - Describe a test application.

SYNOPSIS
       test describe [OPTION]... 

DESCRIPTION
       The describe command describes the configuration of a test
       application.

       The dot output contains the following elements:
       If vertices
           Represented as circles. Branches are dotted, and the default
           branch is in bold.       Configurables
                                        Represented as rectangles. The order
                                        of the output arrows is the order of
                                        the functor arguments.       
                                                              Data
                                                              dependencies
                                                                         
                                                              Represented as
                                                              dashed arrows.
       App vertices
           Represented as diamonds. The bold arrow is the functor part.
DESCRIBE OPTIONS
       --dot
           Output a dot description. If no output file is given, it will
           display the dot file using the command given to --dot-command.

       --dot-command=COMMAND (absent=xdot)
           Command used to show a dot file. This command should accept a dot
           file on its standard input.

       --eval
           Fully evaluate the graph before showing it. The default when the
           unikernel has already been configured.

       --no-eval
           Do not evaluate the graph before showing it. See --eval. The
           default when the unikernel has not been configured.

CONFIGURE OPTIONS
       --context-file=FILE (absent=test.context)
           The context file to use.

       --dry-run
           Display I/O actions instead of executing them.

       -f FILE, --file=FILE, --config-file=FILE (absent=config.ml)
           The configuration file to use.

       -o FILE, --output=FILE
           Name of the output file.

APPLICATION OPTIONS
       --hello=VAL (absent=Hello World!)
           How to say hello. 

       --vote=VOTE (absent=cat)
           Vote. 

       --warn-error=BOOL (absent=false)
           Enable -warn-error when compiling OCaml sources. 

OPTIONS
       --help[=FMT] (default=auto)
           Show this help in format FMT. The value FMT must be one of `auto',
           `pager', `groff' or `plain'. With `auto', the format is `pager` or
           `plain' whenever the TERM env var is `dumb' or undefined.

       --version
           Show version information.

COMMON OPTIONS
       --color=WHEN (absent=auto)
           Colorize the output. WHEN must be one of `auto', `always' or
           `never'.

       -q, --quiet
           Be quiet. Takes over -v and --verbosity.

       -v, --verbose
           Increase verbosity. Repeatable, but more than twice does not bring
           more.

       --verbosity=LEVEL (absent=warning)
           Be more or less verbose. LEVEL must be one of `quiet', `error',
           `warning', `info' or `debug'. Takes over -v.
