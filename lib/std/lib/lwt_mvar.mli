(** Mailbox variables *)

(** "Mailbox" variables implement a synchronising variable, used for
    communication between concurrent threads.

    This code adapted from
    {{:http://eigenclass.org/hiki.rb?cmd=view&p=lightweight-threads-with-lwt}Comparing lightweight threads (eigenclass.org)} *)

type 'a t
  (** The type of a mailbox variable. Mailbox variables are used to
      communicate values between threads in a synchronous way. The
      type parameter specifies the type of the value propagated from
      [put] to [take]. *)

val create : 'a -> 'a t
  (** [create v] creates a new mailbox variable containing value [v]. *)

val create_empty : unit -> 'a t
  (** [create ()] creates a new empty mailbox variable. *)

val put : 'a t -> 'a -> unit Lwt.t
  (** [put mvar value] puts a value into a mailbox variable. This
      value will remain in the mailbox until [take] is called to
      remove it. If the mailbox is not empty, the current thread will
      block until it is emptied. *)

val take : 'a t -> 'a Lwt.t
  (** [take mvar] will take any currently available value from the
      mailbox variable. If no value is currently available, the
      current thread will block, awaiting a value to be [put] by
      another thread. *)
